# PROMPTS

This file summarizes representative AI-assisted prompts used while building and debugging the project.

1. Diagnose 500 error from Workers AI not available; explain correct dev mode and update wrangler config.
2. Add AI binding to wrangler.toml; verify `env.AI` in dev; fix startup instructions.
3. Implement RAG Worker with retrieval, prompt building, and conversation memory.
4. Harden Vectorize retriever; use correct query signature for bound index; guard on embedding validity.
5. Select an available Workers AI chat model; handle response parsing.
6. Implement D1 BM25-style retriever with keyword matching and ranking; relax matching to improve recall.
7. Create scripts to process markdown into D1 import; generate SQL and load into D1.
8. Clean up repository: remove internal guides and debug logs; keep only necessary runtime files and concise README.

These prompts were paraphrased for brevity; they reflect the actual tasks performed in this repository.
